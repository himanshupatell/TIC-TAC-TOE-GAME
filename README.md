# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game from scratch. It allows two players to compete against each other in a 3x3 grid, with the objective of placing their markers (1s and 2s) in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.

## Project Structure

- Notebook File: `TIC TAC TOE.ipynb` - Contains the code implementation of the game along with explanations and outputs.
- Images: `.jpg`   files - Visual representations of the game's implementation and results.

## Features

- Creation of an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
- Checking for empty places on the board.
- Random placement of 1s and 2s for both players.
- Evaluation of the board to determine a WINNER or a TIE.
- Main function `tic_tac_toe()` to start and manage the game.

## Installation

To run the project, make sure you have Python installed. You can use a virtual environment to keep dependencies organized.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
   
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `TIC TAC TOE.ipynb` in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, etc.).
2. Run the cells sequentially to understand the implementation and see the game in action.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to play the game or tweak the code for further enhancements.

## How It Works

### Implementation Planning

- Main Function: `tic_tac_toe()` - Orchestrates the game flow.
- Create Board: Function to generate an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
- Check Empty Places: Function to identify available spots on the board.
- Random Placement: Function to randomly assign positions on the board to both players.
- Evaluate Board: Function to check the board status for a WINNER or a TIE.

### Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their markers (1 or 2) in an empty spot.
- The first player to align three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all spots are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
